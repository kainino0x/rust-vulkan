# rust-vulkan-bind

Vulkan bindings for Rust.

**This project is a WIP and completely unstable!**

Working:
* FFI bindings - will change.
  * I'm experimenting with rewriting them in a more modular format.

In progress:
* ~~Cube demo~~ On hold while working on bindings.

### Usage

This won't be useful at the moment.

```rust
extern crate vulkan_bind;
use vulkan_bind::vk;
```
